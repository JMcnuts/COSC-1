## Internet Standard Organizations 
```
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF): The IETF is a large open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers who are concerned with the evolution and operation of the Internet. It focuses on the development of protocols and standards, with working groups dedicated to specific areas such as routing, security, and web technologies.

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA): IANA is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS root, IP addressing, internet numbers, and other Internet protocol resources. While not primarily a standards development organization, IANAâ€™s role in managing critical Internet resources is vital to the functioning of the Internet.

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): While the IEEE is a broader organization covering various fields of technology, it plays a significant role in developing standards for networking and communication technologies. The IEEE 802 working groups, for example, have developed standards for LANs and wireless networks.
